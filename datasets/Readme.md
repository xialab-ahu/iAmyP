Description: The "TrainingDataset.csv" and "TestingDataset.csv" consist of amyloidogenic hexapeptide samples obtained from the WALTZ-DB 2.0 peptide database. 

The "7-10AAs_Amypeptide.csv" dataset includes sequences of amyloidogenic peptides that vary in length from 7 to 10 amino acids, sourced from the CPAD 2.0 database, totaling 242 samples, and serves to assess the model's ability to generalize and its reliability. 

In addition, the individual datasets for sequences of specific lengths, namely "7AAs_Amypeptide.csv," "8AAs_Amypeptide.csv," "9AAs_Amypeptide.csv," and "10AAs_Amypeptide.csv," are derived from the CPAD 2.0 database.

These datasets are employed to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of the iAmyP model for amyloidogenic peptides across different sequence lengths.
